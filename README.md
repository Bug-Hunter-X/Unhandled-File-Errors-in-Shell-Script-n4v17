This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting: inadequate handling of potential errors during file processing.  The `bug.sh` script attempts to process a file, but fails to check for the file's existence or readability. This leads to script failure if the file is missing or inaccessible. The `bugSolution.sh` script shows how to improve error handling using proper checks and more informative error messages.
